# acOdometer

Every wonder how far you have driven in Assetto Corsa, or how much fuel you've burned setting hot laps and racing friends? This simple plugin will track your sessions, storing distance driven and fuel burned. It might even look good at some point, too.

At the moment, this is very early work. Coming soon, hopefully:

* Track fuel usage
* Store driving sessions in a database
* Track actual distance driven, not a guess based on racetrack lengths
* Animate an odometer
* and more, but I plan to keep this fairly simple

I'll also be writing a beginners guide for Assetto Corsa application development. Unless I missed some documentation, far too much common knowledge had to be pulled out of disparate forum posts and code snippets.
